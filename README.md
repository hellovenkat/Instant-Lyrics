`pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml`

### For Arch users

`sudo pacman -S python2-dbus python2-requests python2-lxml python2-beautifulsoup4`

# Installation

## From source

1. Clone the repository. `git clone https://github.com/bhrigu123/Instant-Lyrics.git`

2. `cd Instant-Lyrics/`

3. Run the command `python InstantLyrics.py`

The icon will appear in the system tray (indicator panel). You can start using the application from there.


# Creating a launcher shortcut

You can either use the application from the terminal, or create a launcher shortcut, which will add the application in your launcher menu:

![Launcher](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6123105/23824317/4735e83e-069a-11e7-8b1e-2814632bb3aa.jpeg)

You can find several ways of doing so. You can also follow the below steps:

(From the terminal)

* `sudo touch /usr/share/applications/instant-lyrics.desktop`. (Creates a new file in /usr/share/applications).

* Open this new file with an editor. Eg. opening with gedit: `gedit /usr/share/applications/instant-lyrics.desktop`. Paste the following in it:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=Instant Lyrics
Comment=Show lyrics of songs instantly
Icon=[path of icon]
Exec=python [path of python file]
Terminal=false
```

Replace `[path of icon]` with the complete path of the icon. The icon is named `icon.svg` inside the root directory of the repository.

Replace `[path of python file]` with the complete path of the file `InstantLyrics.py` which is also in the root directory of the repo.

These two lines should look something like:

```
Icon=/home/ubuntu/Instant-Lyrics/icon.svg
Exec=python /home/ubuntu/Instant-Lyrics/InstantLyrics.py
```

* Save the file.

You should be able to see the `Instant Lyrics` application shortcut in your launcher menu.
